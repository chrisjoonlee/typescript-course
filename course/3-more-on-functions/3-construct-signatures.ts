/*
JavaScript functions can also be invoked with the new operator.
TypeScript refers to these as constructors because they usually
create a new object. You can write a construct signature by adding
the new keyword in front of a call signature:
*/

type SomeConstructor = {
    // @ts-expect-error - Haven't defined SomeObject
    new(s: string): SomeObject;
};
function fn(ctor: SomeConstructor) {
    return new ctor("hello");
}

/*
Some objects, like JavaScriptâ€™s Date object, can be called with or
without new. You can combine call and construct signatures in the
same type arbitrarily:
*/

export { }
